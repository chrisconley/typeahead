typeahead Angular Module
========================

Very barebone angular typeahead module. Creates an autocomplete for input fields

Install
-------

Copy the typeahead.js and typeahead.css file into your project and add the following line with the correct path:

		<script src="/path/to/scripts/typeahead.js"></script>
		<script src="/path/to/scripts/typeahead.css"></script>

Alternatively, if you're using bower, you can add this to your component.json (or bower.json):

		"typeahead": "git://github.com/standup75/typeahead.git"

And add this to your HTML:

		<script src="components/typeahead/typeahead.js"></script>
		<script src="components/typeahead/typeahead.css"></script>

Note that the style is very minimal, it's up to you to make it fit your need.

Usage
-----
		<typeahead>
			<ul ng-repeat="value in autocompleteValues">
					<li>{{value}}</li>
			</ul>
		</typeahead>

And don't forget to add the module to your application

		angular.module("myApp", ["typeahead"])

If you don't want to use the input field generated by the directive, you can use the model attribute:

		<input ng-model="name"/>
		<typeahead model="name">
			<ul ng-repeat="value in autocompleteValues">
					<li>{{value}}</li>
			</ul>
		</typeahead>

Demo
----

Try the (very simple) demo. How to run the demo? Simple...

		git clone git@github.com:standup75/typeahead.git
		cd typeahead
		npm install && bower install
		grunt server

This should open your browser at http://localhost:9000 where the demo now sits.
